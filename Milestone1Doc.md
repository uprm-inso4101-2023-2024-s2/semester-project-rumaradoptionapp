2 Descriptive Part
══════════════════
 
2.1 Domain Description



──────────────────────
 
◊ 2.1.1 Domain Rough Sketch
 
    ·       The structure to adopt pets in most cases is restricted by a form that will help in determining whether the person soliciting is a good candidate and whether they are prepared to adopt. Adopting pets clears the streets of stray animals and more importantly provides a home to a living being that deserves some love. Animal Rescue Shelter provides a temporary home to stray animals and takes care of their basic needs until someone takes on the responsibility to care for the pet. For it the client will go to the Animal Rescue Shelter to start the adoption process.
    
    ·       The process starts with filling out a form that will determine the viability for the client to adopt a pet. After filling in the documentation, the client will now browse the selection of pets that the shelter offers and then select the desired pet based on their preferences. Afterwards they head to the reception again and there they will wait for the shelter to prepare the pet for leaving. At the end the client will take the pet home.
    
    ·       Let’s say that Alex wishes to adopt a dog for his apartment. He would seek shelter and then complete the form. Once that is done, he would then browse for the pet that he wishes to have, let it be a dog or a cat or any other available. The shelter would also suggest pets based on Alex’s preferences and the availability for him to train and/or play with said pet.
    
    ·       Each client must be able to provide feedback on the service provided by the shelter, which will be a good way to understand the clients’ thoughts on customer service and the client’s satisfaction with the selected pet.

2.2 Requirements
────────────────
 
◊ 2.2.1 User Stories, Epics, Features
 
  • Epics are like user stories, but larger. So, an epic cannot be
	implemented in a single sprint and needs to be broken into smaller
	user stories that together make up the epic. Epics can use the same
	"at a XYZ I want to ABC in order to HIJ." format. Remember it's
	important to connect the user story, epic, or feature to a more
	abstract goal that the kind of stakeholder would have.
  • Find the right granularity for the user stories. On the one hand you
	do not want them to be too broad. As in "as a student I want to get
	my enrollment done in order to have time to do more interesting
	things". In this case try zooming in and breaking them apart into
	smaller user stories. On the other hand you don't want them to be
	too detailed. As in "as a student I want to click a square button in
	order to submit my entries in the current screen". In this case take
	a step back and see what the higher-up task is to which this
	contributes. Look for meaning to the student's enrollment tasks
	themselves: does this mean anything in the context of the student
	enrolling?
 
 
◊ 2.2.2 Personas
 
  • Include personas in your documentation. They allow you to justify
	user stories, features, epics, and requirements in general. A good
	way to start developing your personas is to think about yourself (if
	you are a potential user), friends, family, peers, etc. Anyone you
	might want to make use of your software and benefit from your
	project. Then you identify what all these people have in common and
	you condense their important traits into a few "Frankensteins",
	imaginary people whom you give certain traits that you think are
	plausible for a single person to have. Your main goal here: you
	collection of traits must be easy to remember for everyone around
	the team so that just mentioning the name of the persona immediately
	evokes the traits in everyone's mind.
 
 
◊ 2.2.3 Domain Requirements

   • The system must enable shelters to update the availability status of pets in real-time, to reflect whether a pet is still available for adoption.

   • Applicants making adoption requests must be identifiable within the system.
   • The system must allow applicants to filter pets available for adoption based on various criteria such as species, breed, age, and size.
   • The system must associate with every pet listing the set of shelters or individuals who are responsible for that pet. Every pet available for adoption needs to have at least one shelter or individual responsible for its care.
   • The system must provide a way for applicants to express interest in a pet, schedule meetings with shelters, and submit adoption forms.
   • The system must allow a to track the status of their adoption forms.
   • The system must comply with data protection regulations and standards to ensure user privacy and confidentiality. 
   • The system must provide a way for users to add new adoption applications, update existing ones and remove applications. 
   • The system must handle varying levels of traffic and accommodate future growths.
   • The system performance must ensure fast loading times and responsive user experience.
◊ 2.2.4 Interface Requirements
 
  • System administrators or shelter staff, responsible for managing pet profiles, use the administrative interface to initialize and update the value in the system. Through this interface, users can seamlessly update the real-time availability status of pets, reflecting immediate changes observed in the shelter. The system promptly responds by updating the pet’s status, ensuring an accurate representation of pets available for adoption.

  • Shelter administrators or staff tasked with adding pets to the system play a crucial role in initializing and updating the value in the system. Through this interface, users can seamlessly update the real-time availability status of pets, reflecting immediate changes observed in the shelter. The system promptly responds by updating the pet’s status, ensuring an accurate representation of pets available for adoption.

  • Authorized users, such as shelter staff, can efficiently update incorrect or incomplete information using the edit function within the administrative interface. This ensures that the system maintains accurate and complete pet data. Users can select the relevant pet information, make necessary edits or corrections, and the system responds by promptly updating the information.

  • System administrators or staff with update permissions are responsible for reflecting changes in the domain within the system. By accessing the administrative interface or a dedicated update feature, users can enter or edit information when a pet is adopted or undergoes changes in status. The system responds promptly, ensuring an up-to-date representation of pets available for adoption.

  • The system architect or designer plays a key role in decomposing requirements, especially when combining interface and non-interface aspects. Developers implementing pet management features need to design a user interface for pet profile management and develop backend processes for system-generated updates. The system's response involves providing a comprehensive pet management system with both interface and backend functionalities.

  • System analysts or requirements gatherers are instrumental in deriving interface requirements from domain requirements. By analyzing domain requirements for pet adoption, these users identify concepts requiring representation and translate them into interface requirements. This meticulous process ensures that the system effectively obtains and updates data for seamless pet adoption management.

◊ 2.2.5 Machine Requirements
 
    The system shall maintain an average response time of no more than 2 seconds for user interactions, such as searching for pets, viewing profiles, and submitting adoption applications, under normal operating conditions. In the event of a search query, the system shall provide results within 4 seconds, even during peak usage.

    The system shall support a minimum of 300 simultaneous users browsing and interacting with pet profiles. Beyond this threshold, the system shall gracefully degrade its performance, prioritizing essential functionalities such as pet profile viewing and adoption application submission.

    The system shall gracefully handle an increase in user load up to 120 simultaneous users by dynamically allocating resources. Beyond this threshold, new user connections shall be queued, and the system shall restrict additional connections until resources become available.

    The system must be able to run in a desktop web browser.

    Additional requirements are currently under development, and specific criteria for system stability, acceptable degradation of services, and detailed circumstances for heavily loaded conditions will be researched and defined in subsequent project phases.


2.3 Implementation
──────────────────
 
  • The software architecture of the RUMAR Adoption Website captures the holistic view of the system's components and their interrelationships. This high-level perspective outlines the fundamental structure, providing a roadmap for the development team to understand how various modules interact and contribute to the system's overall objectives.

  • Moving beyond architecture, software design delves into intricate details for each component, elucidating the tools, technologies, and methodologies used for implementation. Design documentation becomes a comprehensive guide, outlining specifics like data structures, algorithms, and system interfaces, offering developers a detailed blueprint for actualizing individual modules

  • Diagrams, when used, serve as visual aids to enhance understanding. These visuals should complement textual explanations, providing a more intuitive grasp of the system's structure and functionality. Diagrams might depict the flow of information between components or the overall system architecture, aiding developers and stakeholders in visualizing complex interactions.

  • Screen designs play a pivotal role in conveying the user interface aspect of the system. These screens should align with usage scenarios, illustrating how user interactions are supported and guided by the graphical interface. This visual representation helps validate that the system not only fulfills functional requirements but also provides a user-friendly and intuitive experience.

◊ 2.3.1 Selected fragments of the implementation
 
  • Selected fragments of the implementation serve a specific purpose—they complement natural language explanations when intricate concepts or operations become clearer with visual aids. Code snippets, when incorporated, should be actual code snippets rather than screenshots or word-processed versions. This strategic inclusion is aimed at enhancing the understanding of complex explanations and ensuring clarity in the overall documentation.

  • Quality media, including source code fragments and screen designs, should be seamlessly integrated into the document. Avoid using screenshots or raster images; instead, employ tools like code blocks or scalable file formats (PDF, SVG) for screen designs. This ensures that the media used in the documentation is not just for visual appeal but serves a functional purpose, enhancing the overall clarity and comprehension of the implementation details.
