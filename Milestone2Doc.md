Current Situation, Needs, and Ideas ════════════════════════════
◊ Current Situation ══════════════════════════════════════
The RUMAR Association on campus currently faces significant trouble in the pet adoption
process. One of the primary challenges is the complexity surrounding the adoption process,
which commonly discourages potential adopters from navigating it. The requirements and
steps involved in adopting a pet can be daunting for individuals, leading to a decline in
adoption rates. Moreover, there is a notable lack of promotion for the pet adoption service
offered by RUMAR. Despite the presence of dedicated fosters who provide care to these
animals, the lack of visibility and outreach efforts means that many potential adopters are
unaware of the pets available for adoption. As a consequence, pets may remain in foster care
for extended periods without attracting suitable adoptive homes.
◊ Needs ══════════════════════════════════════
➥ Streamlined Adoption Process: Users seek a simplified and user-friendly adoption
process. They require a process that minimizes complexities and barriers, making it easier for
them to navigate and understand the steps involved in adopting an animal.
➥ Animal Welfare Promotion: There is a need to raise awareness about pet adoption and
animal welfare. Users require access to information that educates them about the importance
of pet adoption, responsible pet ownership practices, and the welfare of animals in need,
empowering them to make informed decisions.
➥ Community Engagement: Users seek opportunities for community involvement and
support. They desire a sense of belonging and connection with like-minded individuals and
organizations within the community, fostering a collaborative environment that benefits both
animals and adopters.

II. Descriptive Part ══════════════════════════════════════
Domain Description ══════════════════════════════════════
◊ Rough Sketch ══════════════════════════════════
➥ The structure to adopt pets in most cases is restricted by a form that will help in
determining whether the person soliciting is a good candidate and whether they are prepared
to adopt. Adopting pets clears the streets of stray animals and more importantly provides a
home to a living being that deserves some love. Animal Rescue Shelter provides a temporary
home to stray animals and takes care of their basic needs until someone takes on the
responsibility to care for the pet. For it the client will go to the Animal Rescue Shelter to start
the adoption process.
➥ The process starts with filling out a form that will determine the viability for the client
to adopt a pet. After filling in the documentation, the client will now browse the selection of
pets that the shelter offers and then select the desired pet based on their preferences.
8
RUMAR ADOPTION APP MILESTONE #2 DOCUMENTATION
Afterwards they head to the reception again and there they will wait for the shelter to prepare
the pet for leaving. At the end the client will take the pet home.
➥ Let’s say that Alex wishes to adopt a dog for his apartment. He would seek shelter and
then complete the form. Once that is done, he would then browse for the pet that he wishes to
have, let it be a dog or a cat or any other available. The shelter would also suggest pets based
on Alex’s preferences and the availability for him to train and/or play with said pet.
➥ Each client must be able to provide feedback on the service provided by the shelter,
which will be a good way to understand the clients’ thoughts on customer service and the
client’s satisfaction with the selected pet.
➥ The website enables users to log in or sign up for an account to access its features.
Once logged in, users are directed to the homepage, serving as a central hub for navigation.
From there, users can easily navigate to pet profiles, which provide detailed information
about each pet available for adoption, including pictures and descriptions. Users can browse
through pet listings and select pets they are interested in. Additionally, the website offers a
seamless transition between different sections, ensuring a smooth user experience. Overall,
the website aims to facilitate the pet adoption process by providing a user-friendly platform
for users to find their perfect companion.
➥ Website aims to facilitate animal adoption within the university community and
promote responsible pet ownership. Explore individual profiles for each animal available for
adoption, showcasing details like name, species, age, breed, personality traits and medical
history.
