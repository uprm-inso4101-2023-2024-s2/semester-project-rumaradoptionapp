Current Situation, Needs, and Ideas ════════════════════════════
◊ Current Situation ══════════════════════════════════════
The RUMAR Association on campus currently faces significant trouble in the pet adoption
process. One of the primary challenges is the complexity surrounding the adoption process,
which commonly discourages potential adopters from navigating it. The requirements and
steps involved in adopting a pet can be daunting for individuals, leading to a decline in
adoption rates. Moreover, there is a notable lack of promotion for the pet adoption service
offered by RUMAR. Despite the presence of dedicated fosters who provide care to these
animals, the lack of visibility and outreach efforts means that many potential adopters are
unaware of the pets available for adoption. As a consequence, pets may remain in foster care
for extended periods without attracting suitable adoptive homes.
◊ Needs ══════════════════════════════════════
➥ Streamlined Adoption Process: Users seek a simplified and user-friendly adoption
process. They require a process that minimizes complexities and barriers, making it easier for
them to navigate and understand the steps involved in adopting an animal.

II. Descriptive Part ══════════════════════════════════════
Domain Description ══════════════════════════════════════
◊ Rough Sketch ══════════════════════════════════
➥ The structure to adopt pets in most cases is restricted by a form that will help in
determining whether the person soliciting is a good candidate and whether they are prepared
to adopt. Adopting pets clears the streets of stray animals and more importantly provides a
home to a living being that deserves some love. Animal Rescue Shelter provides a temporary
home to stray animals and takes care of their basic needs until someone takes on the
responsibility to care for the pet. For it the client will go to the Animal Rescue Shelter to start
the adoption process.
➥ The process starts with filling out a form that will determine the viability for the client
to adopt a pet. After filling in the documentation, the client will now browse the selection of
pets that the shelter offers and then select the desired pet based on their preferences.
Afterwards they head to the reception again and there they will wait for the shelter to prepare
the pet for leaving. At the end the client will take the pet home.
➥ Let’s say that Alex wishes to adopt a dog for his apartment. He would seek shelter and
then complete the form. Once that is done, he would then browse for the pet that he wishes to
have, let it be a dog or a cat or any other available. The shelter would also suggest pets based
on Alex’s preferences and the availability for him to train and/or play with said pet.
➥ Each client must be able to provide feedback on the service provided by the shelter,
which will be a good way to understand the clients’ thoughts on customer service and the
client’s satisfaction with the selected pet.
➥ The website enables users to log in or sign up for an account to access its features.
Once logged in, users are directed to the homepage, serving as a central hub for navigation.
From there, users can easily navigate to pet profiles, which provide detailed information
about each pet available for adoption, including pictures and descriptions. Users can browse
through pet listings and select pets they are interested in. Additionally, the website offers a
seamless transition between different sections, ensuring a smooth user experience. Overall,
the website aims to facilitate the pet adoption process by providing a user-friendly platform
for users to find their perfect companion.

➥ The website aims to foster animal adoption within the university community while
promoting responsible pet ownership. It offers individual profiles for each available animal,
highlighting key details such as name, species, age, breed, personality traits, and medical
history. Through comprehensive profiles, users can make informed decisions, ensuring
successful matches between pets and adopters.
➥ The adoption process at the Animal Rescue Shelter typically begins with a client
expressing interest in adopting a pet. For instance, Alex decides he wants to adopt a dog for
his apartment.
➥ Alex visits the shelter and fills out a form, providing basic information about himself
and his preferences for a pet. This form helps determine his suitability as an adopter and the
type of pet that would best fit his lifestyle.
➥ After completing the form, Alex explores the shelter's available pets, either on his
own or with assistance from shelter staff. He interacts with various animals, considering
factors such as temperament, size, and compatibility with his living situation.
➥ Once Alex finds a potential companion, he spends time getting to know the pet and
may even engage in activities like playing or walking together. The shelter may also provide
guidance on pet care and training based on Alex's preferences and the pet's needs.
➥ If Alex decides to proceed with the adoption, the shelter facilitates the necessary
paperwork and prepares the pet for departure. This may involve medical checks,
vaccinations, and ensuring the pet has necessary supplies for its new home.
➥ Finally, Alex takes his new pet home, embarking on a journey of companionship and
responsibility. The shelter may follow up with Alex to ensure a smooth transition and provide
ongoing support as needed.

Requirements ═════════════════════════════════════════
◊ Personas ══════════════════════════════════════
Personas:
➥ Include personas in your documentation. They allow you to justify
user stories, features, epics, and requirements in general. A good way to start developing your
personas is to think about yourself (if you are a potential user), friends, family, peers, etc.
Anyone you might want to make use of your software and benefit from your project. Then
you identify what all these people have in common and you condense their important traits
into a few "Frankensteins", imaginary people whom you give certain traits that you think are
plausible for a single person to have. Your main goal here: your collection of traits must be
easy to remember for everyone around the team so that just mentioning the name of the
persona immediately evokes the traits in everyone's mind.

Mr. Wilson is also a family man who loves to bring his kids hiking in the vacations,
going to the beach, and exploring all kinds of outdoors activities and adventures.
Upon hearing about the RUMAR project from his sons attending college, Mr Miller
found himself motivated to support the cause. And often visited meetings to learn more about
the people behind the project.
Mr Miller suggested and even pushed for promoting local shelters. Claiming that
putting an emphasis on shelters rather than breeders it will help fight against the stray
problem on the island.
In the face of disagreement Mr Miller expresses worry about the increasing
population of strays, and the suffering these animals often endure. Emphasizing that while
convenience is important, ethics should spearhead the choices of the project.
➥ Persona 2: Amanda Rodriguez
Amanda is a 22 year old undergrad student at college, majoring in electric
engineering! Having a busy life, she often finds pleasure in baking! And if too tired for that,

➥ Venn Diagram:
The image portrays a Venn diagram of two overlapping entities, "Human" and "User,"
representing an object-oriented model.
The "Human" circle encapsulates attributes like “name”, “age”, and “gender”, all of
fundamental data types, indicating that a human has identifiable characteristics. Operations
available for a human are “SetName”, “SetAge”, and “SetGender”, suggesting that these
characteristics can be modified.
The "User" circle, likely representing a system user, contains “username” and “password”
attributes, essential for authentication purposes. The operations include “SetUsername”,
“SetPassword”, indicating that these credentials can be updated, along with “SignIn” or
“LogIn” methods, which would be used to authenticate and establish a session for the user. At
the intersection, highlighting the relationship between a "Human" and a "User," are labels
denoting an "Association," meaning a user is linked with a human, indicating that each user
account represents a real human. "Dependencies" suggest that the user entity relies on the
human's attributes for personal information. Lastly, "Aggregation" implies that a user account
aggregates or collects various elements to form a whole, like sign-in credentials, which
encompass the username and password. This diagram simplifies the conceptual relationship
between humans and their user accounts within a software system, hinting at how personal
information may be used and how user authentication is managed within the system.

➥ Sequence Diagrams:
Login Overview Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram shows the login process in our pet adoption application, which
describes the interactions between user, interface, and database components. It is triggered
when the user accesses the application homepage, which triggers a request to the interface;
this immediately displays the homepage to the user. The interface then responds to the user's
login page request by providing the login interface to the user. The user can then enter their
login credentials into the Interface. Then, the Interface sends the issued credentials to the
Database for validation. If successful, the database confirms the validity of the credentials in
the interface, which in turn logs the user into the application, displays relevant information
such as a profile picture, and displays a homepage. Conversely, if the credentials are invalid,
the database communicates these results to the interface which then notifies the user of the
unsuccessful login attempt.
29
RUMAR ADOPTION APP MILESTONE #3 DOCUMENTATION
Signup Overview Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram for the Signup shows the process of creating an account on our
pet adoption website. The process begins with the User navigating to the HomePage, in
which the User must make a request to the SignupForm interface, which displays the Signup
form to the User. After the form is filled the User then submits the details and they are sent to
the Database. Then the Database checks for any duplicate detail in itself and sends the
response to the User. During this process if the Database finds any duplicates it loops back to
displaying the form so the User can enter new information. If there are no duplicates, the
Database generates the User verification Token and stores it, then the SignupForm interface
sends a link to the User for the EmailVerification interface. This interface awaits the User to
access the link and provide the Token sent in the email. After the interface sends a request to
the Database to compare the Token provided by the User with the one in the Database. Then a
loop occurs if the User provides the incorrect Token, the Database sends a fail verification
message to the interface which displays it to the User. If the User provides the correct Token
then the Database sends the success message to the EmailVerification and the interface
displays it to the User then redirects the User to the LoginPage interface. This is the end of
the Signup process for the User.

RUMAR ADOPTION APP MILESTONE #3 DOCUMENTATION
Pet Registration Sequence Diagram
This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction among the user, interface, and database
components. Initially, the user initiates actions such as accessing the home page, logging in,
and providing credentials. In response, the interface delivers the corresponding pages,
facilitating a smooth user experience. Upon receiving user credentials, the interface
communicates with the database, which verifies the provided information. Upon successful
verification, the interface dynamically tailors the user experience by presenting personalized
home pages enriched with user-specific information. When a user requests the pet registration
page, the interface assesses the user's faculty status, consulting the database for confirmation.
If verified, the user gains access to the pet registration feature, allowing them to effortlessly
input their pet's details. Following submission, the database validates the provided pet
information, ensuring its accuracy and integrity. Subsequently, the interface stores the
31
RUMAR ADOPTION APP MILESTONE #3 DOCUMENTATION
registration data in the database, promptly confirming the successful transaction to the user.
In cases where a user lacks faculty privileges or submits invalid pet information, the system
handles these scenarios. Users are redirected to the appropriate pages, where error messages
guide them through the resolution process, ensuring a user-friendly experience at every step.
➥ Petri Net Diagrams:
Admin Petri Net Diagram
The Admin Petri net outlines a multi-faceted administrative system, beginning with
the "Homepage" where users can log in or sign up. If not logged in, they're directed to the
"LoginPage," with new users proceeding to "SignUp" and existing users entering through
"Valid_User." Administrative functions branch from the homepage to specialized user roles
such as "Faculty," "Foster," and "Admin," each with their own dedicated pages for managing
content. "Faculty" members access "FacultyPage," while "Foster" members are directed to
"FosterMemberPage." Standard users navigate from "Homepage" to view pet profiles or
listings, and manage their account settings, or proceed to log out. Advanced administration is
depicted by the "Manage_Users" flow, indicating oversight capabilities for user accounts.
32
RUMAR ADOPTION APP MILESTONE #3 DOCUMENTATION
Furthermore, dedicated pathways for pet registration and adoption processes are marked,
showing the steps for potential adopters to follow through "FillAdoptionForm" and
"PetProfilePage." The diagram portrays a robust and interactive backend system designed to
facilitate comprehensive management of the website's content and users.
User Petri Net Diagram
The Petri net delineates a user-centric navigation scheme for a pet adoption website,
starting from the "Homepage." New visitors can opt to "SignUp" where they're taken through
a "Registration" and "VerifyEmail" process to authenticate their account. Existing users can
"Login," re-entering the system as a "Valid_User."
The user journey diversifies post-login, offering several distinct paths:
- "Home_Pet" takes users to a "PetProfilePage" for detailed information on pets or to
"FillAdoptionForm" for those wanting to adopt.
- "Home_Faculty" and "Home_Foster" provide specialized portals for users with faculty or
foster roles, leading to dedicated pages "FacultyPage" and "FosterMemberPage,"
respectively.
Additionally, the "Settings_Page" offers personal account management options, and the
"LogOut" procedure ensures a secure exit from the system. For general browsing, the
"PetListingPage" is available for all users, with the "ViewPetDetails" feature providing
extensive information about the pets listed. The Petri net illustrates a comprehensive and
user-friendly interface that allows for seamless navigation through various aspects of the pet
adoption process, tailored to both general users and those with specific roles on the website.
33
RUMAR ADOPTION APP MILESTONE #3 DOCUMENTATION
Pet Petri Net Diagram
The Petri Net delineates a navigation scheme for the pet in the pet adoption website
starting from when the “Pet eligible for adoption”. It will be taken for a “Health Check Up”
in the “Pet Clinic” in which the process of being “Added to the Pet Listing” will take begin
and the pet will be placed in the “Adoption Center” in which his the pet will receive a “Status
Update” from “Unavailable” to “Available” meaning that users can begin their search for a
pet to adopt. While this is happening the pet is in a state of “Waiting” for a user to “Search
through the Pet Listings” for the pet. When the preferred pet is found a “Schedule a Meet and
Greet” is made and the pet is moved to the “Meet and Greet” to see its possible new
Foster/Owner. After the “Meet and Greet” a “Review Adoptio Application” takes place and
the pet is moved to a state of “Awaiting review” in which the pet's will receive another
“Status Update” will be changed to “Pending”.
The pet's journey diversifies after “Awaiting Review”, offering two distinct paths.
- “Adoption Application Rejected” will place the pet back at the “Adoption center” and will
have its “Status Update” reverted back to “Available” where it will wait for a new user to
repeat the process again.
34
RUMAR ADOPTION APP MILESTONE #3 DOCUMENTATION
- “Adoption Application Approved” will place the pet in the “Adoption Completed” state and
will receive its final “Status Update” to “Adopted” and the pet can start its new life with its
new owner.

with users and shelters, giving us information about emerging trends and areas
for improvements. Like, based on stakeholder feedback, we added a feature
allowing shelters to showcase success stories of adopted pets, increasing user
engagement and trust.User persona workshops were conducted to develop
detailed profiles representing the diverse range of website users, helping
stakeholders better understand user needs and preferences.
4. Outcome:
As of now, through rigorous validation and verification processes, the RUMAR Pet
Adoption Website has demonstrated promising levels of usability, functionality, and
stakeholder satisfaction during testing phases. Preliminary user feedback has shown
consistent positivity towards the platform's features and usability.Additionally,
stakeholder confidence in the website's potential to facilitate pet adoptions and
support shelter operations has led to discussions about expanded partnerships and
increased community involvement upon the official launch. Utilizing analytics tools
to track user behavior and engagement metrics post-launch will provide valuable data
for ongoing optimization and decision-making. Furthermore, implementing a
continuous improvement process, where regular reviews and retrospectives are
conducted to identify areas for enhancement based on user feedback, performance
metrics, and emerging industry trends, will ensure the website's continued success and
alignment with user needs and stakeholder expectations. Follow-up user satisfaction
surveys or interviews after a certain period post-launch will be conducted to assess
long-term satisfaction and identify areas for further refinement.
